NWB Inspector
=============
NWB Inspector is a Python-based package designed to asses the quality of Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)
files and based on compliance with Best Practice. This tool is meant as a companion to the PyNWB validator, which checks for strict schema compliance. In contrast, this tool attempts to apply some commonsense rules and heuristics to find data components of a file that pass validation, but are probably incorrect, or suboptimal, or deviate from best practices. In other words, while the PyNWB validator focuses on compliance of the structure of a file with the schema, the inspector focuses on compliance of the actual data with best practices. The NWB Inspector is meant simply as a data review aid. It does not catch all best practice violations, and any warnings it does produce should be checked by a knowledgeable reviewer.
