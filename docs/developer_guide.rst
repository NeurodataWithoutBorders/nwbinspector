Developer Guide
===============

There are many ways to contribute to the NWBInspector!

Please always begin this process by :nwbinspector-issues:`submitting an Issue ticket <>` on the main repository so we can 
openly discuss it taking action. Please do not open a Pull Request (PR) until the Issue has been approved by the team.

The most common contribution is to help us add a new Best Practices and check functions for them. A guideline on how to 
build a new data interface and a graphical overview of the object structure can be found in our primary 
:nwbinspector-contributing:`Contributing <>` page.

Otherwise feel free to raise a bug report, documentation mistake, or general feature request for our maintainers to address!
