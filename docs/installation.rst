Installation
============

This guide assumes the user is familiar with the goals and structure of the NWB standard. 
If you haven't checked it out already, please read the :nwb-overview:`NWB Overview`

The NWBInspector tool offers convenient command-line usage via any standard Conda or Python terminal.

To install the package in any generic Python v3.7-v3.9 environment, simply type

.. :code-block:: bash

    pip install nwbinspector

.. note::

    If the standard Python Package Index (PyPI, where `pip` installs from) is not working for you, it
    should also be possible to install from conda-forge via

    .. :code-block:: bash
    
        conda install nwbinspector

.. note::

    If you are a :matnwb-src:`MatNWB` user, please follow the :conda-install:`installation instructions` to gain access 
    to a Conda/Python terminal and base environment.
